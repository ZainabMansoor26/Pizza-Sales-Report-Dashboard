# Pizza-Sales-Report-Dashboard
I created this Pizza Sales analysis report that involves analyzing sales data using SQL for data management and Power BI for creating interactive dashboards. Key insights and trends were highlighted, with a focus on data accuracy through validation. The dashboards support informed business decision-making.
## Overview
This comprehensive end-to-end data analyst portfolio project explores the 2015 pizza sales data, leveraging MS SQL Server for data import and querying, and Power BI for data cleaning, transformation, DAX measure creation, and interactive dashboard development.
- The project emphasizes rigorous two-way validation, meticulously comparing results obtained from Power BI with SQL query outputs to ensure data accuracy and integrity.
- It features two dynamic, actionable dashboards—the Home Dashboard and Best/Worst Sellers Dashboard—designed to deliver meaningful insights and support strategic decision-making for a client.
## Data Source & Context
The dataset contains detailed sales transactions from a pizza business in 2015, including sales figures, customer data, store locations, and product details. The goal is to analyze sales performance, identify top-performing and underperforming products, and explore regional trends.

## Technologies & Tools Used
- MS SQL Server: For importing, querying, and managing the raw data.
- Power BI Desktop: For data cleaning, transformation, DAX measure creation, and building interactive visualizations.
- SQL (Structured Query Language): For extracting and validating data from the database.
- DAX: For developing measures and calculated columns within Power BI.
## Approach & Methodology
- Data Import & Initial Exploration: Imported raw data into MS SQL Server, performed initial queries to understand data structure and content.
- Data Cleaning & Transformation: Utilized Power BI's Power Query Editor to clean, shape, and prepare the data for analysis.
- Two-way Data Validation: Conducted extensive validation by comparing Power BI results against raw SQL queries to ensure data correctness, accuracy, and consistency.
- Measure & KPI Development: Created key measures such as total sales, revenue, profit margins, and top/bottom performers using DAX.
- Dashboard Design: Built user-friendly, interactive dashboards with filters, slicers, and drill-down capabilities for actionable insights.
- Key Dashboards & Features
1. Home Dashboard
